							<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My interest in IT is more in the field video games and cyber security. The interest of video games began 
						in early childhood, approximately 4 years old with Pokemon on the Gameboy Advance. Having zero knowledge 
						about video games, aimlessly wandering around on a bike and demolishing opposing pokemon at the cost of my 
						own, i fell in love with games. Though i like playing the video games themselves, the behind-the-scenes of 
						the creation of video games was captivating however, the bts of the process were highlights, the time consumed 
						in order to create the game, character models, create a storyline (if there is any), debug and many more 
						operations in order for a game to be created were not completely shown, it was clipped to make the documentaries 
						and process look interesting and fun. Later on in life, about 10 years down the track cyber security caught
						my interest, though having no background of IT through high school, security, is what I wish to pursue at RMIT. 
						Most people state that they chose RMIT because it’s more convenient for them as commuting is easier. 
						My justification for choosing RMIT is because their IT course is what i wanted, flexibility within the 
						field of IT and provides me the opportunity to major in cyber security. During my studies at RMIT, 
						I don’t expect to come out knowing everything about the workforce and having all the experience required 
						for the job that i wish for. However, i do expect to have some knowledge and be able to apply that knowledge 
						to the place i work and be able to complete the tasks that i have been allocated and attempt to go above and 
						beyond what is required.</p>

							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The ideal job for myself would be in the field of information security. The position of security analyst at 
						Peoplebank Australia monitor the network for security breaches and explore for a breach when a breach occurs. 
						Security analysts must also protect sensitive information with the use of firewalls and data encryption programs. 
						Security analyst at Peoplebank Australia is appealing to me because Peoplebank Australia is about the clients 
						and as a security analyst, one has to provide security for the clients and utilises the skills learnt from 
						university and more. The job advertisement is for Peoplebank Australia and the position requires people to have 
						a good understanding of how internal and external networks communicate, have the ability to create and tweak 
						rules and make sure that everything reaches specifications or requirements.</p>

							Each of the tests don’t mean a whole lot to me, however they provide me with an idea of what kind 
							of person I am and how others perceive me in public and such. These results shouldn’t influence 
							my behaviour in a team as the tests are only an indication to what kind of person I am and shouldn’t 
							affect the way I complete allocated tasks as I aim to complete the tasks within allocated time and not 
							wait until it is very close to the deadline to finalise the task. When forming a team, I would use these 
							results as a way to communicate with others, let them know what kind of person I am so that I won’t

							<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
						</header>
						<p>OVERVIEW<br/>
						Imagine having an application to do things for you, where you can initiate the program and have the program 
						detect what kind of software one is working with or have subcategories for their purpose and have a bunch of 
						other tools within the program to then acquire information for the user and filter through what is necessary.
						<br/>
						MOTIVATION<br/>
						The advancement of technology has progressed at godspeed. In 1909, Nikola Tesla predicted that we would have 
						personal wireless devices, in those times, wireless devices seem like science-fiction and in now days, wireless 
						devices have become a norm. According to “The Statistics Portal”, 52.2% of internet website traffic is from the 
						use of these wireless devices. With these advancements, newer technology requires the latest software. To utilise 
						these latest software, more procedures are developed in order to utilise the software and the more the assumed 
						knowledge of an individual in the field of IT requires.
						<a href="#" class="Nikola Tesla"><img src="https://miracomohacerlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nikola-Tesla-1-624x320.jpg" alt="Tesla" /></a>
						<br/>
						DESCRIPTION<br/>
						The end product will be a simple application in a small windows box with a comprehensive list of tools that one 
						can use, anywhere from debugging to benchmarking for a newly built computer. There will be a setting within to 
						change the layout to “advanced” for people who have a better grasp on the variety of applications that one can 
						use for their case. Each tool will have tags for them to indicate what the program can be used for such as 
						benchmarking and data shredding. In the ‘basic’ format of the program, the applications will be organised to 
						categories according to the tags, however, more broad. Advanced layout of the program will have the applications 
						in a list in alphabetical order as hyperlinks. When the hyperlinks are clicked, the user will be directed to 
						another page within the application with the tags that the application comes under and with a brief summary of 
						what the application does. When the user wishes to use the application, a download will then commence and when 
						it does, the program will notify the user about the progress about the download and installation process of the 
						application. After downloading and installing the application, the application will open separately to the program 
						and will be run from there on as the application is only meant to serve as a connection between the user and a vast 
						variety of programs that have been approved by people who know that the application will work and perform and do 
						what it is intended.
						<br/>
						TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES<br/>
						To create the program to link itself to lots of different applications, there are countless applications online 
						that can be found online. The applications used for the program have to be compiled by either one person with 
						knowledge of that many other applications or a community of people compiling a few each and one or a few people 
						to put the list into the program.
						<br/>
						REQUIREMENTS<br/>
						Knowledge of programming in one or multiple languages for the program
						Windows Desktop Program can work in unison with the knowledge of programming.
						There shouldn’t be any special hardware requirement as long as the computer runs with basic 
						requirements such at 4gb of ram, low grade cpu but functions effectively and sufficient memory space.
						To acquire the skills required to create the program won’t come in a day or two, one needs to have knowledge of 
						programming languages beforehand.
						<br/>
						OUTCOME<br/>
						Creating a program that is compiled through a group of people who are specialised by the IT community will assist 
						the user, beginners and experts, in a way that the user won’t have to search the internet for hours upon hours to 
						finally download the tool that they want/needed. The development of the program will help the users save time and 
						discover more applications that do the same thing as others, better or find an application that they prefer.
